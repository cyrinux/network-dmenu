//! Placeholder eBPF program for network monitoring
//!
//! This is a simplified placeholder that demonstrates the structure
//! of an eBPF program. In production, this would use proper eBPF
//! libraries like aya-bpf once they're available.

#![no_std]
#![no_main]

// For now, this is just a placeholder that compiles
// In production, this would contain actual eBPF program logic

use network_monitor_common::{NetworkEvent, NetworkEventType};

// Placeholder main function
// In real eBPF, this wouldn't exist - programs would be defined with macros
fn main() {
    // This won't actually run - eBPF programs don't have main functions
    // This is just to make the compilation work for demonstration purposes
}

// Placeholder structures that would be used in real eBPF programs

/// Placeholder for what would be an XDP program
pub fn packet_monitor_placeholder() {
    // In real eBPF, this would be marked with #[xdp] macro
    // and would process network packets at the kernel level
    let _event = NetworkEvent::new(NetworkEventType::PacketReceived);
}

/// Placeholder for what would be a kprobe program
pub fn netif_receive_skb_placeholder() {
    // In real eBPF, this would be marked with #[kprobe] macro
    // and would attach to the netif_receive_skb kernel function
    let _event = NetworkEvent::new(NetworkEventType::InterfaceUp);
}

/// Placeholder for what would be a tracepoint program
pub fn netdev_state_change_placeholder() {
    // In real eBPF, this would be marked with #[tracepoint] macro
    // and would attach to network device state change tracepoints
    let _event = NetworkEvent::new(NetworkEventType::InterfaceDown);
}

// Note: This file would normally contain proper eBPF program definitions
// using macros like #[xdp], #[kprobe], #[tracepoint] etc.
// The programs would be compiled to eBPF bytecode and loaded by the kernel.
