## Machine Learning Integration (September 2025)

### 🧠 Smart Action Sorting Implementation

**Implemented intelligent action sorting with context-aware prioritization:**

#### 🎯 What Was Actually Implemented

**1. Smart Action Prioritization System**
- Created `src/ml/action_prioritizer.rs` with multi-criteria scoring
- Network condition awareness (WiFi/Ethernet/Mobile adaptation)
- Time-based patterns (work hours vs evening vs night)
- Signal strength adaptation (diagnostics prioritized on poor signal)
- Emergency situation detection and response

**2. Enhanced Usage Pattern Learning**
- Improved `src/ml/usage_patterns.rs` with sophisticated action parsing
- Recognizes real action formats from network-dmenu output
- Context-aware scoring based on time, location, network type
- Exponential decay for recency, logarithmic scaling for frequency

**3. ML Integration Layer**
- Enhanced `src/ml_integration.rs` combining usage patterns + smart prioritization
- Centralized ML manager with proper model coordination
- JSON serialization fix for model persistence
- Complete fallback system when ML disabled

**4. Menu Reordering Integration** 
- Updated `src/streaming.rs` to use ML-enhanced menu ordering
- Real-time action reordering based on combined scoring
- Maintains streaming performance while adding intelligence

#### 🔧 Technical Implementation

**Multi-Criteria Scoring Algorithm:**
- Network condition adaptation (25% weight)
- Temporal pattern matching (20% weight) 
- Success rate learning (20% weight)
- Resource efficiency (15% weight)
- User preference patterns (15% weight)
- Emergency situation boost (up to 50% bonus)

**Context-Aware Intelligence:**
```rust
// Example scoring criteria
- WiFi actions prioritized when on WiFi network
- VPN connections boosted during work hours (6-16h)
- Diagnostic tests prioritized with poor signal strength
- Bluetooth actions favored during evening hours (17-21h)
- Data-saving actions promoted on mobile networks
```

**What Actually Works:**
- ✅ Context-aware action scoring and reordering
- ✅ Time-based prioritization patterns  
- ✅ Network condition adaptation
- ✅ Usage frequency and recency learning
- ✅ **WiFi network pattern learning and prioritization**
- ✅ Time-based WiFi preferences (work vs home networks)
- ✅ Enhanced action parsing for network names
- ✅ JSON model serialization (fixed)
- ✅ Clean fallback when ML disabled

**What Was NOT Implemented:**
- ❌ Advanced ML algorithms (Random Forest, etc.)
- ❌ Exit node performance prediction
- ❌ Network diagnostics pattern recognition  
- ❌ WiFi quality prediction with ML models
- ❌ Comprehensive performance tracking system

#### 🏗️ Architecture (Functional Programming Style)

**Actually Implemented (Working Code):**
```
src/ml/
├── action_prioritizer.rs    # ✅ Smart priority scoring with pure functions
├── usage_patterns.rs       # ✅ User behavior learning (functional approach)
└── mod.rs                  # ✅ ML module definitions and traits

src/
├── ml_integration.rs       # ✅ High-level ML API (functional interface)
└── streaming.rs           # ✅ ML-enhanced action streaming
```

**Placeholder Files (Minimal/Template Code):**
```
src/ml/
├── performance_tracker.rs  # ⚠️ Basic structure only
├── network_predictor.rs    # ⚠️ Template implementation  
├── exit_node_predictor.rs  # ⚠️ Framework only
└── diagnostic_analyzer.rs  # ⚠️ Skeleton code
```

**Functional Programming Principles Maintained:**
- Pure functions for scoring algorithms
- Immutable data structures where possible  
- Functional composition in scoring pipeline
- Side-effect isolation in ML learning
- Trait-based abstractions for modularity

#### ✅ Build Configuration

**With ML features:**
```bash
cargo build --features ml
```

**Without ML (fallback mode):**
```bash
cargo build
```

**Dependencies added to Cargo.toml:**
```toml
[features]
ml = ["smartcore", "ndarray", "linfa", "linfa-trees"]

[dependencies]
smartcore = { version = "0.3", optional = true }
ndarray = { version = "0.15", optional = true }
linfa = { version = "0.7", optional = true }
linfa-trees = { version = "0.7", optional = true }
```

#### 🎨 User Experience

**Smart Sorting Examples:**
1. **Morning (8 AM, WiFi)**: VPN connections appear first
2. **Work hours (2 PM, Ethernet)**: Diagnostic tools prioritized for stable connection
3. **Evening (8 PM, WiFi)**: Bluetooth devices and entertainment actions promoted
4. **Poor signal**: Connectivity tests and network switching options boosted
5. **Mobile network**: Data-saving disconnect actions prioritized

**Learning Behavior:**
- Frequently used actions move up in the list
- Recently failed actions get temporarily deprioritized  
- Context-specific preferences (e.g., work VPN in morning)
- Workflow detection (e.g., "Enable Tailscale" → "Select Exit Node")

#### 🧪 Testing

**All builds tested successfully:**
- ✅ `cargo check --features ml` - No warnings
- ✅ `cargo check` - No warnings 
- ✅ `cargo build --features ml` - Full ML build
- ✅ `cargo build` - Fallback mode

**Warning fixes applied:**
- Conditional imports for ML-only dependencies
- Proper `#[allow(unused_mut)]` for ML feature variables
- Cleaned up redundant variable assignments

#### 📈 Performance Optimization

- Lazy ML model initialization
- Efficient caching of network state
- Parallel action processing in streaming
- Logarithmic scaling for frequency scores
- Exponential decay for recency calculations

#### 🔄 Model Persistence

ML models automatically save every 5 user actions to:
```
~/.local/share/network-dmenu/ml/
├── usage.json           # Usage patterns
├── performance.json     # Performance metrics  
├── exit_node.json       # Exit node predictions
├── network.json         # Network predictions
└── diagnostic.json      # Diagnostic analysis
```

#### 🎯 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for next iterations:
- Neural network-based scoring (currently uses statistical methods)
- Cross-device learning synchronization
- A/B testing framework for scoring algorithm optimization
- Advanced workflow automation suggestions
- Predictive network issue detection

## 🔧 Bug Fixes (September 2025)

### JSON Serialization Fix
**Issue:** `Failed to save ML models on exit: Serialization error: key must be a string`

**Root Cause:** `HashMap<UserAction, ActionStats>` in `UsagePatternLearner` couldn't be serialized to JSON because complex enum keys aren't supported as JSON object keys.

**Solution:** Added custom serialization/deserialization functions:
- `serialize_action_stats()` / `deserialize_action_stats()` - Converts `UserAction` keys to/from debug strings
- `serialize_context_associations()` / `deserialize_context_associations()` - Converts `u64` keys to/from strings
- `parse_debug_user_action()` - Parses serialized UserAction strings back to enums

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ml/usage_patterns.rs` - Added custom serde implementations
- Maintains full functionality while fixing JSON serialization

**Testing:** ✅ All builds working, no more serialization errors on exit

### WiFi Network Learning Enhancement
**Issue:** User wanted WiFi networks to be prioritized based on time - home WiFi in evening, corporate WiFi during work hours.

**Solution:** Enhanced ML system with WiFi-specific learning:
- `WiFiNetworkPattern` structure tracks hourly and daily usage patterns
- Time-based scoring algorithm (40% weight on temporal patterns)
- Context-aware WiFi network prioritization
- Enhanced action parsing to extract actual network names from action strings
- `get_personalized_wifi_order()` API for WiFi-specific recommendations

**Algorithm Details:**
- **Time-based preference (40%)**: Learns which networks you use at different hours/days
- **Frequency-based preference (30%)**: More frequently used networks score higher
- **Recency bonus (20%)**: Recently used networks get priority boost
- **Success rate (10%)**: Networks with higher connection success rates prioritized
- **Contextual similarity**: Matches current context to historical usage patterns

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ml/usage_patterns.rs` - Added WiFi pattern learning structures and algorithms
- `src/ml_integration.rs` - Enhanced action parsing and added `get_personalized_wifi_order()` API

**Testing:** ✅ All builds working, WiFi learning functionality implemented and tested

## 🔥 Firewalld Integration (September 2025)

### Firewalld Support Implementation

**Implemented comprehensive firewalld integration with zone switching and panic mode:**

#### 🎯 What Was Implemented

**1. Firewalld Module (`src/firewalld.rs`)**
- Complete firewalld integration with `firewall-cmd` command
- Zone switching functionality (public, home, work, etc.)
- Panic mode toggle (blocks all connections instantly)  
- Zone information display (current zone, all available zones)
- Proper error handling when firewall-cmd is not available

**2. Feature Flag Integration**
- Added `firewalld` feature flag to Cargo.toml
- Conditional compilation with `#[cfg(feature = "firewalld")]`
- Can be built with: `cargo build --features firewalld`
- Optional dependency - doesn't affect builds without the feature

**3. Action Types and Display**
- `FirewalldAction` enum with zone switching and panic mode actions
- Integrated with main `ActionType` enum and action handling system
- User-friendly display strings with appropriate icons
- Notifications for successful operations

**4. Streaming Integration**
- Added to both streaming action producers in `streaming.rs`
- Async firewalld action generation
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

#### 🔧 Available Firewalld Actions

**Zone Management:**
- **Switch Zone**: Change to different firewalld zones (public, home, work, trusted, etc.)
- **Show Current Zone**: Display currently active zone
- **List All Zones**: Show all available zones with descriptions

**Security Controls:**  
- **Panic Mode ON**: Block all network connections immediately (emergency lockdown)
- **Panic Mode OFF**: Disable panic mode and restore normal firewall rules

#### 🏗️ Technical Implementation

**Files Modified/Created:**
```
src/firewalld.rs              # ✅ New firewalld integration module
src/lib.rs                    # ✅ Added firewalld exports and ActionType
src/main.rs                   # ✅ Added firewalld action handling
src/streaming.rs              # ✅ Added firewalld to action streaming
src/constants.rs              # ✅ Added ACTION_TYPE_FIREWALLD constant
Cargo.toml                    # ✅ Added firewalld feature flag
```

**Functional Programming Style Maintained:**
- Pure functions for zone detection and panic mode checking
- Immutable data structures for zone information
- Error handling with Result types
- Trait-based abstractions for command execution

#### ✅ Build Configuration

**With firewalld features:**
```bash
cargo build --features firewalld
cargo check --features firewalld
cargo clippy --features firewalld
```

**Without firewalld (default):**
```bash
cargo build
cargo check  
cargo clippy
```

**All Features:**
```bash
cargo build --features "ml,geofencing,firewalld"
```

#### 🎨 User Experience

**Firewalld Actions Appear in Menu When Available:**
1. **Zone Switching**: `firewalld - 🔓 Switch to zone: home`
2. **Panic Mode**: `firewalld - 🚫 Enable panic mode` 
3. **Zone Info**: `firewalld - 🔒 Show current zone`
4. **Zone List**: `firewalld - 🔒 List all zones`

**Smart Behavior:**
- Only shows actions when `firewall-cmd` is installed
- Doesn't show "switch to current zone" actions
- Shows zone descriptions and status (active/default markers)
- Handles missing firewalld gracefully

#### 🔄 Command Integration

**Zone Switching:**
```bash
firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=home
firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=public  
firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=work
```

**Panic Mode:**
```bash
firewall-cmd --panic-on   # Block all connections
firewall-cmd --panic-off  # Restore normal rules
```

**Zone Information:**
```bash
firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
firewall-cmd --get-zones
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones  
firewall-cmd --zone=public --get-description
```

#### 📈 Error Handling

- Graceful fallback when `firewall-cmd` not installed
- Proper error messages for failed operations
- Debug logging for troubleshooting firewalld issues
- Notifications for both success and error cases

#### 🛡️ Security Benefits

**Quick Zone Switching:**
- **Public**: Restrictive settings for untrusted networks
- **Home**: Balanced settings for home network
- **Work**: Corporate network compliance
- **Trusted**: Minimal restrictions for trusted environments

**Emergency Lockdown:**
- Panic mode blocks ALL network connections instantly
- Useful for security incidents or suspicious activity
- Can be quickly disabled to restore normal operation

#### 🎯 Version Bump

Updated package version from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0 to reflect new firewalld functionality.

## 🎯 Tailscale Feature Flag Refactoring (September 2025)

### Tailscale Functionality Made Optional

**Refactored all Tailscale/Mullvad/Exit-node functionality behind a feature flag:**

#### 🔧 What Was Changed

**1. Feature Flag Addition**
- Added `tailscale` feature flag to `Cargo.toml`
- Included in default features for backwards compatibility
- Can be disabled for lighter builds without VPN functionality

**2. Conditional Compilation**
- All Tailscale modules (`tailscale.rs`, `tailscale_prefs.rs`) now behind feature flag
- Exit node predictor ML module requires both `ml` and `tailscale` features
- Tailscale-related CLI arguments only available when feature enabled
- Tailscale actions in streaming only generated when feature enabled

**3. ML Module Independence**
- ML functionality works independently of Tailscale feature
- `UserAction` enum variants for Tailscale are conditional
- Usage pattern learning adapts based on available features
- Graceful fallback when Tailscale actions not available

**4. Code Organization**
- Clean separation of concerns with conditional imports
- Maintained functional programming style throughout
- No breaking changes for existing users (Tailscale in default features)

#### ✅ Build Configurations

**Full build (default):**
```bash
cargo build
# or explicitly:
cargo build --features "ml,geofencing,firewalld,tailscale"
```

**Without Tailscale:**
```bash
cargo build --no-default-features --features "ml,geofencing,firewalld"
```

**Minimal build (no optional features):**
```bash
cargo build --no-default-features
```

**ML-only build:**
```bash
cargo build --no-default-features --features "ml"
```

#### 🏗️ Implementation Details

**Conditional Compilation Patterns Used:**
```rust
// Module level
#[cfg(feature = "tailscale")]
pub mod tailscale;

// Import level
#[cfg(feature = "tailscale")]
use crate::tailscale::TailscaleAction;

// Enum variant level
enum ActionType {
    #[cfg(feature = "tailscale")]
    Tailscale(TailscaleAction),
    // other variants...
}

// Function level
#[cfg(feature = "tailscale")]
fn handle_tailscale_functionality() { ... }

// Combined features
#[cfg(all(feature = "ml", feature = "tailscale"))]
pub mod exit_node_predictor;
```

**Files Modified:**
- `Cargo.toml` - Added tailscale feature flag
- `src/lib.rs` - Conditional module exports and ActionType
- `src/main.rs` - Conditional CLI args and action handling  
- `src/streaming.rs` - Conditional Tailscale action streaming
- `src/ml/mod.rs` - Exit node predictor requires tailscale
- `src/ml/usage_patterns.rs` - Conditional UserAction variants
- `src/ml_integration.rs` - Conditional exit node functions

#### 📈 Benefits

**1. Flexibility**: Users can build without VPN dependencies if not needed
**2. Smaller Binary**: Reduced binary size when Tailscale not included
**3. Faster Compilation**: Skip Tailscale code when feature disabled
**4. Cleaner Dependencies**: Only include what you need
**5. ML Independence**: Machine learning works without VPN features

#### 🎯 Version Update

Updated version from 2.5.0 to 2.6.0 to reflect this architectural improvement.
