# Claude Code Development Notes

## Machine Learning Integration (September 2025)

### 🧠 Smart Action Sorting Implementation

**Implemented intelligent action sorting with context-aware prioritization:**

#### 🎯 What Was Actually Implemented

**1. Smart Action Prioritization System**
- Created `src/ml/action_prioritizer.rs` with multi-criteria scoring
- Network condition awareness (WiFi/Ethernet/Mobile adaptation)
- Time-based patterns (work hours vs evening vs night)
- Signal strength adaptation (diagnostics prioritized on poor signal)
- Emergency situation detection and response

**2. Enhanced Usage Pattern Learning**
- Improved `src/ml/usage_patterns.rs` with sophisticated action parsing
- Recognizes real action formats from network-dmenu output
- Context-aware scoring based on time, location, network type
- Exponential decay for recency, logarithmic scaling for frequency

**3. ML Integration Layer**
- Enhanced `src/ml_integration.rs` combining usage patterns + smart prioritization
- Centralized ML manager with proper model coordination
- JSON serialization fix for model persistence
- Complete fallback system when ML disabled

**4. Menu Reordering Integration** 
- Updated `src/streaming.rs` to use ML-enhanced menu ordering
- Real-time action reordering based on combined scoring
- Maintains streaming performance while adding intelligence

#### 🔧 Technical Implementation

**Multi-Criteria Scoring Algorithm:**
- Network condition adaptation (25% weight)
- Temporal pattern matching (20% weight) 
- Success rate learning (20% weight)
- Resource efficiency (15% weight)
- User preference patterns (15% weight)
- Emergency situation boost (up to 50% bonus)

**Context-Aware Intelligence:**
```rust
// Example scoring criteria
- WiFi actions prioritized when on WiFi network
- VPN connections boosted during work hours (6-16h)
- Diagnostic tests prioritized with poor signal strength
- Bluetooth actions favored during evening hours (17-21h)
- Data-saving actions promoted on mobile networks
```

**What Actually Works:**
- ✅ Context-aware action scoring and reordering
- ✅ Time-based prioritization patterns  
- ✅ Network condition adaptation
- ✅ Usage frequency and recency learning
- ✅ **WiFi network pattern learning and prioritization**
- ✅ Time-based WiFi preferences (work vs home networks)
- ✅ Enhanced action parsing for network names
- ✅ JSON model serialization (fixed)
- ✅ Clean fallback when ML disabled

**What Was NOT Implemented:**
- ❌ Advanced ML algorithms (Random Forest, etc.)
- ❌ Exit node performance prediction
- ❌ Network diagnostics pattern recognition  
- ❌ WiFi quality prediction with ML models
- ❌ Comprehensive performance tracking system

#### 🏗️ Architecture (Functional Programming Style)

**Actually Implemented (Working Code):**
```
src/ml/
├── action_prioritizer.rs    # ✅ Smart priority scoring with pure functions
├── usage_patterns.rs       # ✅ User behavior learning (functional approach)
└── mod.rs                  # ✅ ML module definitions and traits

src/
├── ml_integration.rs       # ✅ High-level ML API (functional interface)
└── streaming.rs           # ✅ ML-enhanced action streaming
```

**Placeholder Files (Minimal/Template Code):**
```
src/ml/
├── performance_tracker.rs  # ⚠️ Basic structure only
├── network_predictor.rs    # ⚠️ Template implementation  
├── exit_node_predictor.rs  # ⚠️ Framework only
└── diagnostic_analyzer.rs  # ⚠️ Skeleton code
```

**Functional Programming Principles Maintained:**
- Pure functions for scoring algorithms
- Immutable data structures where possible  
- Functional composition in scoring pipeline
- Side-effect isolation in ML learning
- Trait-based abstractions for modularity

#### ✅ Build Configuration

**With ML features:**
```bash
cargo build --features ml
```

**Without ML (fallback mode):**
```bash
cargo build
```

**Dependencies added to Cargo.toml:**
```toml
[features]
ml = ["smartcore", "ndarray", "linfa", "linfa-trees"]

[dependencies]
smartcore = { version = "0.3", optional = true }
ndarray = { version = "0.15", optional = true }
linfa = { version = "0.7", optional = true }
linfa-trees = { version = "0.7", optional = true }
```

#### 🎨 User Experience

**Smart Sorting Examples:**
1. **Morning (8 AM, WiFi)**: VPN connections appear first
2. **Work hours (2 PM, Ethernet)**: Diagnostic tools prioritized for stable connection
3. **Evening (8 PM, WiFi)**: Bluetooth devices and entertainment actions promoted
4. **Poor signal**: Connectivity tests and network switching options boosted
5. **Mobile network**: Data-saving disconnect actions prioritized

**Learning Behavior:**
- Frequently used actions move up in the list
- Recently failed actions get temporarily deprioritized  
- Context-specific preferences (e.g., work VPN in morning)
- Workflow detection (e.g., "Enable Tailscale" → "Select Exit Node")

#### 🧪 Testing

**All builds tested successfully:**
- ✅ `cargo check --features ml` - No warnings
- ✅ `cargo check` - No warnings 
- ✅ `cargo build --features ml` - Full ML build
- ✅ `cargo build` - Fallback mode

**Warning fixes applied:**
- Conditional imports for ML-only dependencies
- Proper `#[allow(unused_mut)]` for ML feature variables
- Cleaned up redundant variable assignments

#### 📈 Performance Optimization

- Lazy ML model initialization
- Efficient caching of network state
- Parallel action processing in streaming
- Logarithmic scaling for frequency scores
- Exponential decay for recency calculations

#### 🔄 Model Persistence

ML models automatically save every 5 user actions to:
```
~/.local/share/network-dmenu/ml/
├── usage.json           # Usage patterns
├── performance.json     # Performance metrics  
├── exit_node.json       # Exit node predictions
├── network.json         # Network predictions
└── diagnostic.json      # Diagnostic analysis
```

#### 🎯 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for next iterations:
- Neural network-based scoring (currently uses statistical methods)
- Cross-device learning synchronization
- A/B testing framework for scoring algorithm optimization
- Advanced workflow automation suggestions
- Predictive network issue detection

## 🔧 Bug Fixes (September 2025)

### JSON Serialization Fix
**Issue:** `Failed to save ML models on exit: Serialization error: key must be a string`

**Root Cause:** `HashMap<UserAction, ActionStats>` in `UsagePatternLearner` couldn't be serialized to JSON because complex enum keys aren't supported as JSON object keys.

**Solution:** Added custom serialization/deserialization functions:
- `serialize_action_stats()` / `deserialize_action_stats()` - Converts `UserAction` keys to/from debug strings
- `serialize_context_associations()` / `deserialize_context_associations()` - Converts `u64` keys to/from strings
- `parse_debug_user_action()` - Parses serialized UserAction strings back to enums

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ml/usage_patterns.rs` - Added custom serde implementations
- Maintains full functionality while fixing JSON serialization

**Testing:** ✅ All builds working, no more serialization errors on exit

### WiFi Network Learning Enhancement
**Issue:** User wanted WiFi networks to be prioritized based on time - home WiFi in evening, corporate WiFi during work hours.

**Solution:** Enhanced ML system with WiFi-specific learning:
- `WiFiNetworkPattern` structure tracks hourly and daily usage patterns
- Time-based scoring algorithm (40% weight on temporal patterns)
- Context-aware WiFi network prioritization
- Enhanced action parsing to extract actual network names from action strings
- `get_personalized_wifi_order()` API for WiFi-specific recommendations

**Algorithm Details:**
- **Time-based preference (40%)**: Learns which networks you use at different hours/days
- **Frequency-based preference (30%)**: More frequently used networks score higher
- **Recency bonus (20%)**: Recently used networks get priority boost
- **Success rate (10%)**: Networks with higher connection success rates prioritized
- **Contextual similarity**: Matches current context to historical usage patterns

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ml/usage_patterns.rs` - Added WiFi pattern learning structures and algorithms
- `src/ml_integration.rs` - Enhanced action parsing and added `get_personalized_wifi_order()` API

**Testing:** ✅ All builds working, WiFi learning functionality implemented and tested
